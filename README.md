#### About

Welcome to my portfolio. I am a graduate Bioinformatician with interests in data analytics, data science, software development and biostatistics.  Here I showcase small projects and exercises I have done throughout my learning and career. Feel free to have a look.

#### [ICU Classification Task](https://github.com/JasonUUO/Classification-of-ICU-data) 
This project was done as coursework for the machine learning module in MSc Bioinformatics. In this project, I created three classification models on an ICU dataset. 

#### [PubMed Webscraper](https://github.com/JasonUUO/Pubmed_Rabies_Webscraper)
In my spare time, I wanted to create a web scraper that would scrape PubMed for journals of a specified disease. It can now count how many journals there are of a specified disease. I have plans to expand the function of the web scraper soon.
#### [Unsupervised Learning in R and Python](https://github.com/JasonUUO/Unsupervised_learning_R_and_Python)
This project contains unsupervised learning techniques applied to different datasets using both R and python. This project was coursework for the data science module.

#### [Practising SQL](https://github.com/JasonUUO/Practising_SQL)
This repository contains SQL scripts which creates and queries a database for a fictional university. This was created during my time at the Tech Talent data bootcamp

#### [Biopython Exercises](https://github.com/JasonUUO/Biopython_Exercises) 
This repository contains Biopython excersises I did in the data science for bioinformatics modules in University of West London.
